	// ENCAPSULATION: the practice of
	// hiding date in one part of a program from code in another part.

	// Many other programming languages encapsulate data with CLASSES (a concept similar, but not identical, to a Go type).

	// In Go, data is encapsulated within PACKAGES,
	// using unexported variables, struct fields, functions, or methods.
